ts-rcon is a simple library for connecting to RCON servers in node.js implemented in TypeScript.
Based on [pushrax/node-rcon](https://github.com/pushrax/node-rcon).
It implements the protocol used by Valve's Source and GoldSrc engines,
as well as many other game servers.

It was originally created to connect to Minecraft's RCON server.

## Installation

```shell
npm install ts-rcon
yarn add ts-rcon
```

## Usage

See [`examples/`](examples/) for examples.

Some games use TCP and some use UDP for their RCON implementation. To tell
node-rcon which protocol to use, pass it an options object like so:

```javascript
var options = {
  tcp: false,       // false for UDP, true for TCP (default true)
  challenge: false  // true to use the challenge protocol (default true)
};
client = new Rcon(host, port, password, options);
```

Here's a non-exhaustive list of which games use which options:

| Game              | Protocol  | Challenge |
| :---------------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| Any Source game   | TCP       | N/A       |
| Minecraft         | TCP       | N/A       |
| Any GoldSrc game  | UDP       | Yes       |
| Call of Duty      | UDP       | No        |

Source games include CS:S, CS:GO, TF2, etc. GoldSrc games include CS 1.6, TFC,
Ricochet (lol), etc.

If there's a game you know uses a certain protocol, feel free to submit a pull
request.

Please submit a bug report for any game you try that doesn't work!
